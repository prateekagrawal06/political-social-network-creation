"# CS579: Assignment 1\n",
    "## Collecting a political social network\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, I've given you a list of Twitter accounts of 15 U.S. presedential candidates.\n",
    "The goal is to use the Twitter API to construct a social network of these accounts. We will then use the [networkx](http://networkx.github.io/) library to plot these links, as well as print some statistics of the resulting graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy the files from this directory into the `asg/a1` folder of your private repository.\n",
    "2. Create an account on [twitter.com](http://twitter.com).\n",
    "3. Generate authentication tokens by following the instructions [here](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/tokens-devtwittercom).\n",
    "4. Add your tokens to the `twitter.cfg` file. (API Key == Consumer Key)\n",
    "5. Be sure you've installed the Python modules [networkx](http://networkx.github.io/) and [TwitterAPI](https://github.com/geduldig/TwitterAPI). Assuming you've already installed [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html), you can do this with `pip install networkx TwitterAPI`.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, now you're ready to start collecting some data!\n",
    "\n",
    "I've provided a partial implementation below. Your job is to complete the code where indicated.  \n",
    "You only need to modify the 6 methods indicated by **#TODO**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your output should match the samples provided below."
